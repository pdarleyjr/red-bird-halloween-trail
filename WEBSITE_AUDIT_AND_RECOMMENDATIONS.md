# Halloween Website Audit & Enhancement Recommendations

_Last reviewed: October 16, 2025_

## Overview
This audit reviews the static Halloween event website as hosted on GitHub Pages (main branch), focusing on mobile-first, accessibility, performance, and user experience. All recommendations are compatible with static hosting.

---

## Issues & Problems Identified

### Accessibility
- No skip-to-content or landmark navigation for screen readers.
- Some color contrasts may be insufficient for visually impaired users.
- Missing ARIA roles/labels on some interactive elements.
- Not all images have descriptive alt text (verify all decorative images).
- No language attribute on some pages (ensure all have `lang="en"`).

### SEO
- No favicon or Apple touch icon.
- No Open Graph/Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.
- No structured data (JSON-LD) for event info.
- No robots.txt or sitemap.xml.

### Performance
- Large images (logo, flyer) could be further optimized for mobile (smaller sizes, WebP/AVIF).
- No lazy loading for non-critical images (except flyer preview).
- No critical CSS inlined (optional, but can speed up first paint).
- No service worker or offline support (optional for static, but can improve experience).

## Enhancement & Optimization Recommendations

### Mobile-First & Responsive Design
- Ensure all tap targets (buttons/links) are at least 48x48px.
- Add “Back to Home” button on each page for easier navigation on mobile.
-Add a view counter (make it small and very modern on the home page)
- Add subtle animations/transitions for page elements (fade-in, hover, etc.).

### User Experience
- Add a countdown timer to Halloween night for excitement (Use a Halloween themed / style working countdown).
- Add a “share” button for social media (pre-filled with event info).
- Add a “find my location” button on the map page (if you know of a way to integrate that successfully with Google My Maps / Goodle).
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

### SEO & Social Sharing
- Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags.
- Add a favicon and Apple touch icon.
- Add robots.txt and sitemap.xml for search engines.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for the event.

### Performance
- Compress and optimize all images (WebP/AVIF for modern browsers, fallback to PNG/JPG).
- Use `loading="lazy"` for all non-critical images.
- Consider inlining critical CSS for faster first paint.
- Use a manifest.json for PWA support (improves mobile installability).

## Quick Wins
- Add missing alt text and ARIA labels.
- Add favicon and social meta tags.
- Optimize large images and enable lazy loading.
- Add skip-to-content link and ensure keyboard navigation.

## Conclusion
The site is well-structured and visually appealing, but can be further enhanced for accessibility, performance, and user experience—especially on mobile devices. All recommendations are compatible with static hosting on GitHub Pages.
